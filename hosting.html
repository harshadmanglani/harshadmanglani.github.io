    Until the innovation of cloud services, if you wanted your own website, you had to buy/rent physical servers. This brought along not only server costs
    but also other costs such as renting physical space, cooling systems for servers, paying for on-location security, hiring someone who knows how to
    work with servers, etc.
    <br>
    Luckily, for us, long gone are the days of incurring all these costs just to host a website. Ever since Amazon came out with Amazon Web Services, more commonly
    known as AWS, and as other giants followed, we can now host a website in minutes! We'll be using Microsoft Azure as our Cloud Service provider and we'll
    be hosting our website as well as our database on Azure.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>NOTE: </b>
    You'll need a student account (you can get one by emailing Azure support with your college ID card) on Azure before you proceed so you can work with
    the $100 credit given to you instead of having to actually pay.

    We'll be using Azure Web Apps to host our Django website. Instead of listing out the steps here, I'm going to direct you to this awesome Medium Article,
    where the steps are explained.
    <br>
    <br>
    Article - 
    <a href="https://medium.com/python-pandemonium/building-and-deploying-an-enterprise-django-web-app-in-16-hours-79e018f7b94c">Django Deployment on Azure</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    Something fun to note, you'll actually learn <b>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</b> throughout this hosting.
    <br>
    <br>
    As another prerequiste, you'll also require a GitHub account.
  </p>
  <h3 style="padding-top: 20px;">Database</h3>

    You'll be hosting the database on Azure, which is by creating a MySQL server. On the resources page, it looks something like this:

    <br>
    Luckily, the steps for how to connect your database to Django have been listed in the article. Something to watch out for, do not open source your
    repository since your username and password for the database are present in the settings.py file in the Django project.
